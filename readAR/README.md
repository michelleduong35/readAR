## Overview

### Description
ReadAR, short for Read Radar, is an app that uses OpenLibrary API to recommend users books. Users can then swipe to save, or mark the book as "not interested." Users will also be able to undo their most recent action, view their favorites, and tap the book for more information.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** The convenience of having favorited books on your phone and UI
- **Story:** A huge resource to the reader community, as it would make finding the next read more easily. My friends would love this idea.
- **Market:** Definitely niche audience, just readers and perhaps those interested in getting into reading with recommendations.
- **Habit:** Users who read often would probably continously return to the app to add new recs and see what their next read should be. (Creates a list)
- **Scope:** Could be a bit technically difficult, but the core app implements a lot of features I already know.

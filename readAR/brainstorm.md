# Evaluating App Ideas
## Baby Name Generator
**Description:** Allows users to view and save randomly generated baby names. 
**Category:** Lifestyle
**Mobile:** Not much, could be a website.
**Story:** Definitely niche, for funsies and brainstorming. My friends would probably like the app, but find that they don't use it often.
**Market:** Not too large of a market, perhaps parents or young adults just being curious. Not a huge value added.
**Habit:** Creates a list, frequency would peak when needed (deciding a name), but otherwise be quite low. (Creates a list)
**Scope:** Pretty simple, as the idea is pretty basic.


## Book Recommender
**Description:** Allows users to view and save randomly generated books. 
**Category:** Entertainment
**Mobile:** The convenience of having favorited books on your phone and UI
**Story:** A huge resource to the reader community, as it would make finding the next read more easily. My friends would love this idea.
**Market:** Definitely niche audience, just readers and perhaps those interested in getting into reading with recommendations. 
**Habit:** Users who read often would probably continously return to the app to add new recs and see what their next read should be. (Creates a list)
**Scope:** Could be a bit technically difficult, but the core app implements a lot of features I already know.

## Final Decision: readAR (book recommender)
